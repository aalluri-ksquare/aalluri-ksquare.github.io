        Senna was one of the greatest inspirations to race cars, and the only driver in this list not to hail from a European country. 
        He was born in Sao Paolo to a wealthy factory owner and excelled when he began racing go-karts aged 13, usually beating competitors years older than him. 
        To push for success in motorsport, Senna relocated to England to race in single-seaters.

        After he won the British Formula 3 Championship in 1983, he took the step up to Formula 1 in 1984. 
        He raced a comparatively uncompetitive Toleman to ninth place in the championship, before finishing third in ’85 and ’86, registering his first win in Portugal in 1986.

        Following a spell at Honda, his greatest successes came with McLaren where he would form an intense rivalry with teammate Alain Prost. 
        The pair dominated the 1988 season, both winning all but one race with Senna the victor. 
        Prost took victory in 1989, courtesy of a highly controversial crash in the season’s penultimate race, which saw the Brazilian disqualified.

        Prost moved to Ferrari the next year, but both drivers remained the main protagonists. 
        It once again came down to the penultimate race in Japan where, yet again, the rivals collided. 
        That meant Prost couldn’t mathematically win the championship, and Senna was crowned with his second title. 
        He followed it up with a consecutive championship for McLaren, the third of his career.

        Senna raced with Williams in 1994, but tragically lost his life in a high-speed crash during the San Marino Grand Prix.
        Formula 1 had prematurely lost one of its greats, but he had left a legacy that would never be forgotten.
